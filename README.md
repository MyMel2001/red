The FOSS version of Indigo (Swift).

## Credits

* Myself - making it
* AI (remaining secret) - helping me (bc I'm bad at CSS and web security)
* gold.is.eepy.now - Making and designing the original "Swift" project and providing some hints on how it works so I could cleanroom reverse engineer it.


## How to install

* Install NodeJS/NPM
* Git clone this repo
* Copy ".env.example" to ".env"
* Edit ".env" to your needs ***(IMPORTANT, THIS CONTAINS SAMPLE KEYS THAT NEED CHANGING AND CAN'T BE DONE LATER.)***
* Install dependencies using "npm i"
* Run with "npm start"
* Server is now running at the port you specified in ".env"!
